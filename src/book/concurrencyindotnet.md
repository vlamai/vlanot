[Concurrency in .NET](https://www.manning.com/books/concurrency-in-dot-net)

Functions composition is the combining of functions in the manner where output of one function is the input of another function. This is a very powerful concept in functional programming. It allows us to create complex functions from simple ones. It also allows us to create a pipeline of functions that can be used to process data.

Composition of functions used functions without side effects.

A closure is a function that has access to the parent scope, even after the parent function has closed.
A closure is a first-class function with free variables that are bound in the lexical environment.
