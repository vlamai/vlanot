# os

## process

informally speaking, a process is a program in execution.

the program itself is lifeless, but when it is executed, it becomes a process.

the os creates illusion of multiple processes running simultaneously by switching between them very quickly. by **virtualization**, the os makes it appear that each process has its own processor.
