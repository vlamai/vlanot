[Asynchronous programming patterns](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/asynchronous-programming-patterns/)

three patterns:

1. Event-based asynchronous pattern (EAP)
2. Asynchronous programming model (APM)
3. Task-based asynchronous pattern (TAP)

### TAP

witch use `Task` and `Task<T>` to represent asynchronous operations and  uses a single method to represent the initiation and completion of an asynchronous operation.
